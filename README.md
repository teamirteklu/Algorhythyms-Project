# Description
Our project was a lyric finder site. Excuetion was search by song title and artist. This will yield lyric results and in the event that it doesn't it will display a message informing the user. The search will also also populate a table that displays the top 3 albums, songs, and genres for the search query; as well as labum covers.

# Description

For this project my team and I wanted to create a website for finding lyrics to a specific song. Once the lyrics to song are found, the artist, genre, and their other top tracks are shown. We wanted to create a responsive website that users can use on all platforms. We used bootstrap as a starting point to provide some structure to the website.
When the user types in a song title and artist, the song lyrics are displayed, along with the artists top tracks. Additionally, new song recommendations are displayed, based off the song and artist the user searched, allowing users to expand their music libraries.

# Installation

We used two Web APIs. Lyricsplus/Rapidapi to find the song lyrics, and musixmatch to make further song recommendations.
