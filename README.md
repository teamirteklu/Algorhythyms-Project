# Description
    For this project my team and I wanted to create a website for finding lyrics to a specific song. Once the lyrics to that song are found the artits, genre, and the artits other top tracks are shown as well. We wanted to create a responsive website that users can use on all platforms. We used bootstrap as a starting point to provide some structure to the website. When the user types in any song, album, or artist, then that artits or album cover is presented along with the top songs and the genre that it is in. My team and I wanted to present other songs and albums by the artits/song that is being searched because we wanted to allow users to be able to find new songs realted to the one they just searched. This way the user can expand their music selection.

# Installation 
We used two Web API's in order to find the lyrics and match the artits and song to that lyric. Also we used javaScript and bootstrap CSS to style and bring functionality to the web-page.
