# Description

For this project my team and I wanted to create a website for finding lyrics to a specific song. Once the lyrics to song are found, the artist, genre, and their other top tracks are shown. We wanted to create a responsive website that users can use on all platforms. We used bootstrap as a starting point to provide some structure to the website.
When the user types in a song title and artist, the song lyrics are displayed, along with the artists top tracks. Additionally, new song recommendations are displayed, based off the song and artist the user searched, allowing users to expand their music libraries.

# Installation

We used two Web APIs. Lyricsplus/Rapidapi to find the song lyrics, and musixmatch to make further song recommendations.
